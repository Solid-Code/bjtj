# Legality of Online Gambling

## Key Resource
 1. [According to Legalzoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/online-gambling-is-it-legal)

## TL;DR

"As there is no federal law against playing online, simply placing wagers online is legal. However, a wager must NOT be placed on a site located in the United States." [1]

"If you are planning to operate an online gambling site, stay outside of the United States. You must also deal only with casino and poker wagers (not sports bets) from people in the US." [1]

"As of 2006, it became illegal for American banks to process transactions originating from or directed toward any online gambling operator." [1]

"Online casinos and operators still accept American players. And international financial parties have continued to process their transactions. The legality is always changing and there have been attempts to declare online wagering against the law, but for now, US citizens who simply place bets online are in the clear." [1]

## Thoughts

Digital ocean offers droplets located in Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, and Bangalore. Once my BJVM is ready to deploy, I'll research these & figure out out which would be the most legal-friendly location.
