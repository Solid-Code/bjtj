HTTPS is more secure for two reasons: 
 1. Your traffic is encrypted so that shady guy in a hoodie at your coffee shop can't snoop on your wifi traffic
 2. An authority has validated that the owner of https://domain.com is who they claim to be

Letsencrypt will be our authority because they have automated the process of proving domain name ownership.
