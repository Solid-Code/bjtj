# How to Buy Bitcoin

Sup Malachi

Buying bitcoin is really easy, you can either find someone willing to sell you some or go to an exchange.

Exchanges are great, they're fast & reliable. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) is the most popular and I absolutely love it. They require you to set up an account though and will often require some sort of identification. Also, there's stories of people's accounts being closed because they used the bitcoin from coinbase to buy illegal things online so something to keep in mind. I think you can start buying from coinbase as soon as you give them some payment info. Super easy & straightforward, can't mess it up. (Except I think Ana messed it up)

Finding other people to buy from is a little trickier. I've used [local bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) a couple times and am happy with it. I had to physically go to a bank though and deposit money in some dude's bank account so it's not very convenient but it is more anonymous and there are no hard-limits to how many bitcoin you can buy, unlike with coinbase. The dude I bought from on local bitcoins was a professional trader who makes a living by buying low/selling high. Therefore the rates you'll see here are generally a couple hundred dollars per BTC higher than coinbase.

Or, if you have a friend with a bunch of bitcoin, you can just ask them to sell you a bit.

Let me know if you have any other questions. Eventually, I want this website to be a great place for cryptocurrency beginners but for now I just have a few random pages with info requested by friends. Any questions or, especially, things you're curious about which don't make sense are exactly what I want to include so just text if you need to know anything. (or use the feedback form once I fix it)

Also, this is not a great time to tinker around with small amounts of BTC because the transaction fees have been really high lately ($2-$5 per transaction). It sucks but there are solutions in the making that should solve this issue eventually. It doesn't matter if you buy on coinbase and don't move them around but if you want to spend the bitcoin or transfer them to a personal wallet be prepared to pay some transaction fees..
